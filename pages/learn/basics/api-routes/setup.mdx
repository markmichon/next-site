import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'
import SkipPageButton from '../../../../components/learn/SkipPageButton.js'

export const meta = {
  title: 'API Routes',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'api-routes',
  stepId: 'setup'
}

**If you’re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip this page. Click the button below to go to the next page.

<SkipPageButton meta={meta} />

### Download Starter Code (Optional)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This will set up a `nextjs-blog` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson, and then starts the development server.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
# If you prefer Yarn, you can use `yarn create` instead of `npm init`
npm init next-app nextjs-blog --example "https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-starter/tree/master/api-routes-starter"
cd nextjs-blog
# If you prefer Yarn, you can use `yarn dev` instead
npm run dev
```

Once you download your starter code, you should update:

- `public/images/profile.jpg` with your photo (Recommended: 400px width/height).
- `const name = '[Your Name]'` in `components/layout.js` with your name.
- `<p>[Your Self Introduction]</p>` in `pages/index.js` with your self introduction.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
